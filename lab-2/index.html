            <h2>5 – Conclusion</h2>
            <p>We selected Lamborghini because we found it intriguing to see how Lamborghini markets its goods to a certain target 		       market. Who do they sell these pricey products to and how do they do it? We didn’t know a lot about the Lamborghini, their 	       background, organizational structure, and management style.</p>
	    <p>We found out the Lamborghini, provide a SWOT analysis, and discussed their current leadership structure and business 		       strategy.</p>
